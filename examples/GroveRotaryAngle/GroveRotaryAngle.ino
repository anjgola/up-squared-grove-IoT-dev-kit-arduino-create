  Grove Rotary Angle

  Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog pin 0 and
  turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 4.
  The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on the value obtained
  by analogRead(). Also demonstrates the use of the serial port with the DebugSerial function.
  An offset of 512 is applied because the Grove Pi+ board is a subsystem.  See the Blink example 
  for more details.

  Make sure to be connected to your board 'via Cloud' for the DebugSerial function to work. If
  you prefer to see the serial output over the micro USB cable, change all instances of DebugSerial
  to Serial.
