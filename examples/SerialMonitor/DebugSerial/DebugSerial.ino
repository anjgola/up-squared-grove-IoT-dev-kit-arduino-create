  DebugSerial
  Learn how to set up a serial monitor. Youâ€™ll use built-in functions to set up, transmit, and receive data over serial, which is very useful for debugging.
  
  Make sure you open the Monitor after uploading this sketch.  DebugSerial only works on devices connected 'via Cloud'

  This sample can be imported into Intel System Studio 2018, Linux hosts only.
  * Free IDE includes optimized libraries, application analysis tools, and debugging tools
  * Import tutorial: https://software.intel.com/en-us/developing-projects-with-intel-system-studio-c-importing-arduino-create-projects
