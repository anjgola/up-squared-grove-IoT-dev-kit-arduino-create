  Serial
  Learn how to set up a serial monitor. Youâ€™ll use built-in functions to set up, transmit, and receive data over serial, which is very useful for debugging.
  
  Make sure you open the Monitor after uploading this sketch.  Serial only works on UP Squared devices connected over micro USB.
